# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project analyzes survival patterns in the Titanic dataset using Python. Key steps include:
- Data cleaning (handling missing values, outliers).
- Exploratory analysis (univariate, bivariate, and multivariate).
- Visualization of trends (gender, class, age, fare).

## Key Insights
- **74% of women survived** vs. 19% of men.
- **1st-class passengers** had a 63% survival rate vs. 24% for 3rd class.
- Children under 10 had a **59% survival rate**.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter`.
